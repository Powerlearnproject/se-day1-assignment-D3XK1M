Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development, ensuring efficiency, reliability, security, and scalability in modern technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-1960s: The emergence of assembly language and high-level programming languages like FORTRAN.
1970s-1980s: Introduction of structured programming and software development methodologies like Waterfall.
1990s-Present: Rise of Agile, DevOps, cloud computing, and AI-driven software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis -> Gathering user needs.
Design -> Planning the system architecture.
Implementation -> Writing the actual code.
Testing -> Ensuring the software works correctly.
Deployment -> Releasing the software for use.
Maintenance -> Fixing bugs and updating features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methods are a linear, structured approach best for projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., government systems).
Agile methods are an iterative, flexible approach ideal for projects requiring continuous updates (e.g., mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -> Writes, tests, and maintains code.
Quality Assurance Engineer -> Ensures software quality through testing.
Project Manager -> Oversees project timelines, resources, and team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code) provide coding tools, debugging, and automation for efficient development while
VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub) enable version tracking, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing complex codebases, can be solved by use of modular design and documentation.
Debugging and testing, which can be solved by implementing automated testing and logging.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing -> Tests individual components for correctness.
Integration Testing -> Tests how components interact with each other.
System Testing -> Tests the entire system for functionality.
Acceptance Testing -> Verifies the system meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the practice of designing effective input prompts to guide AI models in generating relevant and accurate responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Write a story about a character who is a hero."
Improved prompt: "Write a 500-word story about a young woman who saves her community from a......"
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear requirements and constraints for the AI model to work with.
